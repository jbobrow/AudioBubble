# Audio Bubble ðŸŽ§ ðŸ«§


An iOS app that creates an "audio bubble" for you and your friends to converse in a loud place. The app requires the use of headphones, ideally ones with active noise-cancelling, so that all participants can hear each other when otherwise it would be difficult to converse.
